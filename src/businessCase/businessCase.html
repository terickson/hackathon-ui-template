                    <h3>Pollination and Bee Management for Farmer</h3>
                    <p>Bees are a scarce resource and becoming more scarce.  They are also necessary for farming and we can help farmers mange that scarce resource for a fee.</p>

                    <h3>Governmental Initiatives to save Bee Population</h3>
                    <p>Since Bees are so important for food supply governments are trying to fund initiatives to help save Bee populations.  We are providing a service that not only has real data about Bees used in farming, that can be used for analysis, but we are offering the community of Bee Researchers the ability to directly influence farmers behavior with Bees by being part of our global community.  This should allow us to apply for governmental grants for our work.</p>

                    <h3>Product/Service Resale</h3>
                    <p>This product will require us to have a reliable outdoor wireless network and something like Cisco's Meraki line that can be used outdoors and manage through cloud services might be ideal for farmers who don't have time to manage networks themselves.  We could even offer to manage it for them, for a fee.</p>

                    <h3>Other IOT Services</h3>
                    <p>As more challenges present themselves to farmers such as modernization of farming practices and global warming, IOT in other areas besides Bee management is going to become a greater need for farmers and this will give us an area to grow our business as time goes on.</p>
